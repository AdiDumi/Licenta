This repository contains the files for the graduation project for Computer Science, University Politehnica Bucharest.

The application was developed in close coordonation with Bitdefender company to facilitate the feedback exchange between employees and help them grow closer.

For the front-end with all its pages was used React that connects to the Node.js back-end with a MongoDB local database. For accounts, the app was connected
to the LDAP server of a company, all of them being deployed using docker.

The LDAP server must be started first and, when the server becomes active, automaticaly connects to the application.
